- implement color management support
- support non-Canon printers
- document exit codes (fun for the whole family)
- better driver path translation (WINE provides functions for that)
- implement passthrough for GDI32/WINSPOOL functions implemented in WINE
  (This is essential for drivers where we have to use the interface DLL
  because they usually make liberal use of the GDI32 API)
