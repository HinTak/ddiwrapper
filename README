1. INTRODUCTION

ddiwrapper can load a Windows 2000/XP printer driver, feed bitmap data into
it, and produce printer code. It currently works well for most Canon inkjet
printer drivers. It uses WINE as a binary loader and for most of the Win32
API infrastructure.


2. QUICKSTART

This section will help you getting a working setup for printing to your
Windows-only printer via CUPS and the Windows XP printer driver.

a. Make sure you have a recent version of WINE installed. Anything released
after August 2004 should work fine.

b. Run "make && make install"

c. Get the Windows 2000 or XP driver archive for your printer from the
driver download section of the Canon web site of your choice.

d. Install the driver, preferably to /usr/share/ddiwrapper/drivers/default

  excanondriver <driver>.exe /usr/share/ddiwrapper/drivers/default

If you install it to a different directory, you will have to change the PPD
file accordingly before injecting it into the CUPS system. excanondriver
uses cabextract, unzip and recode, so make sure you have these installed.

e. Inject the PPD file into the CUPS system

  lpadmin -p ddiwrapper -v usb:/dev/usblp0 -P doc/ddiwrapper.ppd -E

This will create a printing queue called "ddiwrapper" that, if printed to,
will pipe PostScript input through GhostScript, ddiwrapper and the Windows
printer driver out to your USB printer. If you are using a graphical user
interface such as kprinter you can use it to choose paper format, paper
type, duplex mode and printing quality.

f. Finished. Now you should be able to print to your formerly unsupported
Canon printer through CUPS.


3. TESTED DRIVERS/PRINTERS

"Dry" testing means that I fed an input file into the driver and checked if
it produces output of sensible size and content. "Wet" testing means that I
have sent the output to an actual printer to check if it looks right.

4. DEVELOPMENT

You are very much encouraged to enhance ddiwrapper in any way you see fit,
especially by adding support for non-Canon printers. Read the file
doc/HACKING for hints that may help you getting started.


5. CONTACT

Please send patches, patches, and patches to uli@suse.de. Please think very
hard before asking questions. If you still have questions after that, send
